## Conclusion

Frequencies profoundly affect human biology through resonance, entrainment, and direct cellular interaction. While some effects are scientifically validated (Schumann resonance, brainwave entrainment), others remain in the realm of alternative medicine. The key is conscious, informed experimentation while respecting the power of these invisible forces that constantly influence our biological systems.

Remember: We are fundamentally vibrational beings living in a vibrational universe. Understanding and working with beneficial frequencies while minimizing exposure to harmful ones may be crucial for optimal health and consciousness expansion in our increasingly electromagnetic world.
