# Breakaway Civilization Visualizations

## Overview
Interactive web-based visualizations revealing the hidden patterns connecting ancient monuments, underground bases, genetic bloodlines, and modern phenomena into one unified system.

## Features

### 1. **Global Energy Grid Map**
- Interactive world map showing ley lines connecting ancient sites
- Layer toggles for:
  - Ley lines (electromagnetic conduits)
  - Ancient monuments (sized by power level)
  - Underground bases
  - Missing 411 clusters
  - Crop circle locations
  - Recent UAP sightings
  - 5G tower overlay on ley lines

### 2. **Galactic Cycle Timeline** (In Development)
- Spiral visualization showing 12,000-year catastrophe cycles
- Current position indicator showing approach to next crossing
- Key events marked throughout history

### 3. **Bloodline Activation Tree** (In Development)
- Interactive genealogy showing RH negative distribution
- Real-time activation tracking
- Geographic clustering visualization

### 4. **Additional Visualizations** (Planned)
- Earth's Hidden Architecture (3D underground network)
- Electromagnetic Symphony (real-time Schumann resonance)
- Lunar Control System (Moon-Earth interactions)
- Master Convergence (all systems integrated)
- Evidence Correlation Matrix
- Antarctic Revelation (layered maps)
- Live Global Awakening Tracker

## Technical Stack
- **D3.js** - Data visualization and mapping
- **Three.js** - 3D visualizations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Core functionality
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom animations

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Navigate between visualizations using the top menu
3. Toggle layers on/off in the Global Energy Grid
4. Click on points for detailed information
5. Watch real-time updates in the status bar

## Data Sources
- Monument coordinates from archaeological databases
- Missing 411 data from David Paulides research
- UAP sightings from public reports
- Ley line calculations based on sacred geometry
- Underground base locations from leaked documents

## Key Patterns Revealed
- All phenomena cluster at electromagnetic nodes
- 12,000-year cycles align with galactic crossings
- Underground bases connect via natural cave systems
- Genetic activation triggered by Antarctic signal
- 5G infrastructure deliberately overlays ancient grid

## Development Notes
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Real-time data simulation for live tracking
- WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations
- Modular architecture for easy expansion

## Future Enhancements
- VR/AR support for immersive exploration
- Real-time data feeds from monitoring stations
- Machine learning pattern recognition
- Crowd-sourced sighting reports
- Predictive modeling for future events
