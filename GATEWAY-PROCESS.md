## The Gateway Affirmation

The official affirmation used in all Gateway exercises:

```
"I am more than my physical body. Because I am more than physical matter, I can perceive that which is greater than the physical world. Therefore, I deeply desire to Expand, to Experience, to Know, to Understand, to Control, to Use such greater energies and energy systems as may be beneficial and constructive to me and to those who follow me. Also, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, the assistance, the understanding of those individuals whose wisdom, development, and experience are equal to or greater than my own. I ask their guidance and protection from any influence or any source that might provide me with less than my stated desires."
```

4. **Human Potential**: Far greater than publicly acknowledged
5. **Technology Integration**: Consciousness tech is operational

## Final Notes

The Gateway Process represents one of the most significant disclosed programs revealing government understanding of consciousness. While publicly available materials provide powerful techniques, it's clear that classified applications have advanced far beyond what's been released. The techniques remain valuable tools for personal exploration of consciousness, offering a scientifically-validated path to experiences traditionally relegated to mysticism.

Remember: "The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind." - William James, as quoted in the Gateway materials.
